4.List(its insertion/deletion is fast but random acess is slow)-done
4.1 push_front()-doen(pop,push,swap,size,empty)
4.2 push_back()

4.dequeue(sme as list but in dequeue-random acess provided but insertion,deletion is slow)-done
4.1 push_front()-doen(pop,push,swap,size,empty)
4.2 push_back()

Always prefer dequeue over list in CP.
